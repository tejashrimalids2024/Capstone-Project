Gender Prediction Using Dental Features

## Introduction
This project uses dental metrics to predict gender through data analysis and machine learning.

## Tools & Technologies
- *MS-Excel*: Data preprocessing and EDA.
- *Jupyter Notebook*: Coding and model implementation.
- *Python*: Data manipulation and model building (Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).

## Methodology
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Cleaned and formatted data using MS-Excel.
2. *EDA*: Analyzed trends and correlations via Python visualizations.
3. *Model Building*: Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for prediction.
4. *Result Analysis*: Identified the best-performing model with metrics like accuracy and precision.

## Results
Achieved [specific accuracy]% with [best-performing model], uncovering patterns in dental features and gender classification.
